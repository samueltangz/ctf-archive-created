## Description

Do you know Rainbolt? If you send him a photo, he could immediately tell you where it was taken in.

Can you do the same in the Minecraft world?

Note: If you are desperate, you can watch [Rainbolt's most insane geoguessr moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KXcQ18JyMs), or [LiveOverflow's video series on Minecraft Hacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekcseve-mOg&list=PLhixgUqwRTjwvBI-hmbZ2rpkAl4lutnJG).

By the way, the map is generated with Minecraft 1.17.1. With that said, you may be unable to look for the better caves.
