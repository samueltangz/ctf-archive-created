## Description

You need a key to open the door... but what if the key is in the room?

By the way, if you find this challenge similar to HKCERT CTF 2022's "Catch-22", it is. I literally plagarized that, except that:

1. I used CBC instead of ECB to encrypt the token, and
1. I made the map a little bit smaller, and
1. I changed the category from crypto to misc,
1. I refacted the code a little bit to make the logic clearer.

By the way, if you want the source code for Catch-22, there you go: https://github.com/samueltangz/ctf-archive-created/tree/master/20221111-hkcert-ctf/catch-22/public
