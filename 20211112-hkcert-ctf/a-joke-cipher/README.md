In the beginning of 2020, Khaled A. Nagaty invented a cryptosystem based on key exchange. The cipher is faster than ever... It is impossible to break, right?

To solve this challenge, you need to read the source code `chall.py`. Try to get those questions answered:

- Can `shared_key` generated from `y_A` and `y_B`?
- If so, how do we calculate `m` from `c` and `shared_key`?
- How can we convert the number `m` into a flag that is in the format `hkcert21{...}`?

## Flag

`hkcert21{th1s_i5_wh4t_w3_c4ll3d_sn4k3o1l_crypt0sy5t3m}`
